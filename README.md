Weather Dashboard

This is an app designed to retrieve and present up-to-date weather forecasting using the OpenWeather API system.

To use this dashboard, simply type in the name of the city for which you want to get the weather, then click the Search button. You will see the current weather forecast in the center of the page, which displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV Index.

Below this, you will also see a projected 5-day forecast containing the same weather data.

Below the Search button, you will see a list of recent cities for which you have searched. Simply click on the name of that city to recall the current and 5-day forecasted weather.
